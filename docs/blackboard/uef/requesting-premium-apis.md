Premium APIs offer several new capabilities for integrations with
Learn Ultra experience.

## Our Premium APIs

### Ultra Extension Framework

UEF is a set of Premium APIs that augment the Ultra experience of
Learn. We designed a robust set of capabilities such as
telemetry, help provider registration, and UI element rendering to
enable better integrations and richer user experience.
Take a look at [First steps with UEF](./uef_getting_started.md) to get started.
