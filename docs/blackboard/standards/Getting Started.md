Anthology believes in that support for standards is a necessary component of our integration strategy and in the delivery of our products.

## What are Standards?

Standards are published documents that establish technical specifications and procedures designed to maximize the reliability of the materials, products, methods, and/or services people use every day.

Technology standards can also provide a framework that enables devices from different manufacturers to communicate with one another. That’s why, for example, your EV automatically connects to your home Wi-Fi network as soon as you pull into the garage. You didn’t have to think about connecting. It all happened automatically, behind the scenes, ensuring that your maps and playlists are always up to date.

In the process, standards provide a stable but continually evolving foundation that enables entire industries to develop and thrive. Think of standards as recipes. By following them, developers get highly detailed information about how devices identify one another, how data flows between them, and how it’s kept secure, to name just a few examples.

## Why are Standards Important?

Standards are important for a number of reasons, including:

1. Standards Improve interoperability and compatibility: Standards provide a common language and technical framework that enable different products, systems, and services to work together seamlessly. This promotes interoperability, compatibility, and integration, which are essential for many industries and domains.
2. Enhancing efficiency and productivity: Standards can help to streamline processes, reduce waste, and improve efficiency and productivity. Standards can also help to reduce costs, increase profitability, and promote sustainable development.
3. Fostering innovation and competitiveness: Standards can promote innovation by establishing common benchmarks, enabling collaboration and knowledge-sharing, and encouraging experimentation and creativity. Standards can also help to improve competitiveness by leveling the playing field and promoting fair competition.

Without standards, it would be difficult to ensure consistency, reliability, and interoperability across different products, services, and systems.

Additionally, standards-based interoperability gives consumers the freedom to mix and match different manufacturers’ products.

## What Standards does Anthology Support?

Anthology supports many standards across our our product portfolio. Some of the key supported e-learning and educational technology standards include:

**Caliper**: Caliper is a standard from [1EduTech](https://www.1edtech.org) and is a specification for collecting learning analytics data. The Caliper standard provides a common language and technical framework for capturing and sharing data related to student engagement, performance, and outcomes across different learning platforms and systems. In addition to defining a set of data elements and metrics the standard also defines a set of technical requirements for implementing the standard.

**Common Cartridge**: Common Cartridge is a standard from [1EduTech](https://www.1edtech.org) for packaging and sharing e-learning content across different platforms and systems. Blackboard Learn&trade; supports Common Cartridge 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, which enables users to import and export content packages that conform to the Common Cartridge standard.

**LIS**: Learning Information Services is a standard from [1EduTech](https://www.1edtech.org). Blackboard Learn's integration with LIS allows institutions to automate the exchange of academic and enrollment data between Blackboard Learn (LMS) and the institution's student information system (SIS). This integration can help to streamline administrative processes, reduce errors, and improve data accuracy and consistency.

**SCORM**: Sharable Content Object Reference Model is a widely used standard for e-learning content interoperability. SCORM 1.2 and 2004, enable users to create, import, and deliver SCORM-compliant content within the Blackboard Learn LMS. Details are available at [SCORM.com](https://scorm.com) and [Rustici Software](https://rusticisoftware.com)

**QTI**: Question and Test Interoperability is a standard from [1EduTech](https://www.1edtech.org) for creating and sharing assessment items and tests. Blackboard Learn supports QTI 1.2 and 2.1, which enables users to create and import QTI-compliant assessment content and deliver it within Blackboard Learn.

Anthology also supports other standards related to accessibility, security, data privacy, and other aspects of e-learning and educational technology.
